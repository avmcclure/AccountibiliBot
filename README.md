# AccountibiliBot

## Dependencies

* [Discord.Net](https://discordnet.dev)

## Local development

In the `/src` folder, create a file called appsettings.Local.json. You will need to add two entries
* token - this is the application token on the `Bot` page of the discord
* testGuild - your test server ID. I'd recommend creating a test server and adding your own personal bot to that
